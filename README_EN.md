# CF-M365-Admin

A community-friendly **Microsoft 365 (Office 365) self-service provisioning and lightweight admin panel** powered by **Cloudflare Workers + Microsoft Graph API**.  
Serverless, fast to deploy, and practical for labs, internal self-service, demos, or small-to-mid teams.

## ✨ What’s New (Current Release)

### ✅ Frontend (User Side)
- Self-service Microsoft 365 user registration
- Subscription options show remaining quantity, e.g. `E1 (Remaining: 200)`
- Subscription list automatically sorted by remaining quantity (highest first)
- **Password policy**: Uppercase / lowercase / numbers / symbols — **3 of 4**, length ≥ 8  
  - Real-time frontend validation; blocked if invalid (saves compute/API calls)
- **Reserved/protected usernames are forbidden** (local-part level, e.g. `admin`, `root`)  
  - Hard-blocked with a strong warning modal
- Mobile-first UX: no horizontal scrolling, no overflow tables, viewport-safe modals

### ✅ Admin Panel
- Custom admin path (reduce scanning/noise)
- Admin login with **username + password** (session cookie)
- “Globals” management (Tenant / Client / Secret / domain / SKU mapping)
- “Fetch SKU” button becomes available only after TenantId/ClientId/ClientSecret are provided
- User management: search/pagination/sorting, bulk reset password, bulk delete
- Invitation codes: generate/export/delete, restrict by Global+SKU, usage limits
- License view: total/used/remaining; optionally shows subscription lifecycle/expiration date (if permitted)
- **Protected usernames**: reserved for security; **cannot be registered or deleted** via UI/API
- Fully responsive UI; modals and toolbars optimized for mobile

## 🧩 Legacy vs Current & Migration Guide (Read This)

This section explains what changed and how to migrate smoothly.

### 1) Configuration model (Legacy env vars → Current KV + setup wizard)
Legacy versions are typically configured via Workers environment variables like `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `DEFAULT_DOMAIN`, `ADMIN_TOKEN`, `SKU_MAP`, etc.  
Current version introduces **a setup wizard + KV-based configuration**, which is better for multiple globals, invitations, and settings.

**Migration tips:**
- If you only have one tenant: create a single Global in the admin panel and copy values from your legacy env vars.
- If you used `SKU_MAP`: use “Fetch SKU” to rebuild and manage SKU mapping in the admin panel (no need to store large JSON in env vars).

### 2) Admin authentication (Legacy token query → Current username/password login)
Legacy admin entry is often ` /admin?token=ADMIN_TOKEN `.  
Current version uses `/{adminPath}/login` with **username + password** and a session cookie.

**Migration tips:**
- Run the setup wizard once to set admin credentials and admin path.
- For production environments, consider placing the admin path behind Cloudflare Access or WAF rules.

### 3) Protection rules (Legacy full UPN protection → Current reserved usernames / local-part protection)
Legacy `HIDDEN_USER` typically protects a full UPN (exact match).  
Current version standardizes to **reserved usernames** (local-part, e.g. `admin`). This prevents “first deploy got hijacked” scenarios.

**Migration tips:**
- If you previously protected `admin@tenant.onmicrosoft.com`, add `admin` to the protected username list.
- If you have multiple domains: local-part protection protects all `admin@*` automatically.

### 4) Subscription UX (Legacy “type only” → Current “remaining + sort”)
Legacy versions emphasize SKU mapping and license usage queries.  
Current version shows remaining quantity on the homepage and sorts the list by availability.

**Security note:**
- Remaining quantity is rendered server-side without exposing admin querying APIs to the frontend.

### 5) Mobile UX (Legacy overflow risk → Current responsive/viewport-safe)
Current release fixes: overflow tables, oversized modals, huge close buttons, and bulky toolbar layout on mobile.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites (Kept from Legacy)

You will need (same as legacy):  
1. A **Cloudflare account** (Workers + KV / variables)  
2. **Microsoft 365 Global Admin** privilege (to create an App Registration)  
3. An **Azure AD / Entra ID App Registration**:
   - `Client ID`, `Tenant ID`
   - `Client Secret` (use the Value, not the Secret ID)  
   - Graph API **Application permissions** + Admin consent  

> Start with minimal permissions: `User.ReadWrite.All`.  
> For subscription lifecycle/expiration display you may also need `Directory.Read.All` or `Organization.Read.All`.

## ⚙️ Deploy to Cloudflare Workers (Current)

### 1) Create KV Namespace
Workers → KV → Create namespace  
Recommended:
- `CONFIG_KV`

### 2) Create/Update Worker
Paste `worker.js`  script into your Worker and deploy.

### 3) Bind KV
Worker Settings → Bindings  
- KV namespace bindings:
  - `CONFIG_KV`

### 4) Optional env var (hard “silent protection”)
- `HIDDEN_USER`: comma-separated **reserved usernames** (local-part only)  
  - Example: `admin,root,superadmin`

> Legacy releases rely heavily on env vars (e.g. `SKU_MAP`, `ADMIN_TOKEN`, etc.).  
> Current release recommends managing config in KV via the setup wizard and admin panel.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Deploy Worker and bind `CONFIG_KV`
2. Visit your Worker domain to open the setup wizard
3. Configure:
   - Admin username
   - Admin password
   - Admin path (e.g. `/admin` or `/console`)
4. Open admin panel → create a Global (Tenant) and fill Tenant/Client/Secret/domain
5. Click “Fetch SKU” to build SKU mapping
6. (Optional) Enable invitation-only mode and generate invite codes
7. Test the homepage registration flow (including on mobile)

---

## 📖 Usage

### User Side
- Visit the homepage
- Select a subscription (shows remaining; sorted by availability)
- Enter username & password (3-of-4 rule enforced client-side)
- Reserved usernames are blocked with a strong warning modal

### Admin Side
- Visit `https://your-domain/{adminPath}/login`
- Manage globals, users, invites, settings, and security controls

---

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

- **404 on admin pages**: you probably changed the admin path — use the new one
- **“Fetch SKU” disabled**: ensure TenantId/ClientId/ClientSecret are filled
- **No subscription expiration date**: permissions likely missing — verify Graph app permissions + Admin consent
- **Remaining quantity looks stale**: it is server-rendered; switching globals triggers refresh
